# Stata Github Configuration Files

This repository contains two dofiles that allow the user to automate the process of initializing a github repo from within Stata, commit and push changes to that repo.

It is initially intended for personal use but, of course, it can be downloaded and customized to fit your needs. It works just fine combined with the **[Stata project structure configurator](https://github.com/rodrigofcaba/Stata-project-structure-generator)**.
